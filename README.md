# Houston-Housing-Burden-Health-Outcomes
Executive Summary
(2–3 sentences)
 Summarize your analysis goal: to examine whether areas in Houston with higher housing cost burden also experience worse health outcomes, and discuss what that means for city policy.
Example:
Households spending a disproportionate share of income on housing often face trade-offs with healthcare and other essentials. This analysis investigates the relationship between housing cost burden and key health indicators in Houston to inform equitable policy responses.

Background
(3–4 sentences)
 Provide context:
Houston has a large share of cost-burdened households, especially among renters and low-income families. City of Houston+1


Housing cost burden can reduce resources available for health-promoting goods and services.



Data & Methods
(4–5 bullets)
Data Sources:
American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates (housing cost burden, income)


CDC PLACES (health outcomes like poor physical health days / diabetes prevalence)


Geography:
 ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) covering Houston and Harris County
Variables:
Independent: % households cost-burdened (>30% or >50%)


Dependent: selected health outcomes (poor physical health days, rates of chronic disease, etc.)


Analysis:
 Correlational analysis and mapping of key indicators.

Findings
(Short bullets / visuals)
Areas with the highest housing cost burden tended to show worse health indicators


Highlight a couple of specific examples (e.g., ZIP codes most burdened and their health status)


Use simple graphs or a scatterplot to illustrate the association


Policy Implications
(3–5 bullets)
Housing affordability policies (e.g., rent stabilization, expansion of affordable units) could support better health outcomes.


Integrating housing support with community health services (e.g., local clinics) may mitigate health risks.


Data suggests prioritizing neighborhoods with both high burden and poor health for targeted programs.


Limitations
(1–2 bullets)
Correlation does not imply causation


Limited by the level of geographic precision


Conclusion
(1–2 sentences)
 Summarize your analysis and argue that addressing housing affordability is not only a housing issue, but a public health concern.
